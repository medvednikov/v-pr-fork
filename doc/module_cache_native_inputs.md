# Native inputs in the module cache

With `-new-compiler -cc cc`, applications importing `compress.zstd`, including `veb`
applications, can use the module and program caches. Cached module objects share one
copy of V's bundled zstd implementation in the program translation unit. Other units
use the public declarations embedded in the bundled amalgamation. Changes to the
native source remain cache inputs and invalidate affected entries. Bundled mbedTLS
headers are checked with the selected C preprocessor, using the generated units' C
or Objective-C language, and their active dependencies are tracked. C++ contexts,
custom native configuration directives, renamed SDK bindings, and forced
headers keep the conservative fallback when their original context cannot be reconstructed.
Production, shared, and GNU89 inline modes retain this fallback for bundled mbedTLS headers.

Set `V3_CACHE_TRACE=1` to inspect cache decisions, and use `-show-timings` to see
`monomorphize (cached)` on an unchanged build. External native inputs without a safe
ownership or replication policy still fall back to an uncached build. TCC selection
continues to follow the compiler's existing cache eligibility rules.
