## Description

`xml` is a module to parse XML documents into a tree structure. It also supports
validation of XML documents against a DTD.

Note that this is not a streaming XML parser. It reads the entire document into
memory and then parses it. This is not a problem for small documents, but it
might be a problem for extremely large documents (several hundred megabytes or more).

The public function `parse_single_node` can be used to parse a single node from
an implementation of `io.Reader`, which can help parse large XML documents on an
element-by-element basis. Sample usage is provided in the `parser_test.v` file.

## Usage

### Parsing XML Files

There are three different ways to parse an XML Document:

1. Pass the entire XML document as a string to `XMLDocument.from_string`.
2. Specify a file path to `XMLDocument.from_file`.
3. Use a source that implements `io.Reader` and pass it to `XMLDocument.from_reader`.

```v
import encoding.xml

//...
doc := xml.XMLDocument.from_file('test/sample.xml')!
```

### Validating XML Documents

Simply call `validate` on the parsed XML document.

### Querying

Check the `get_element...` methods defined on the XMLDocument struct.

### Escaping and Un-escaping XML Entities

Parsing decodes predefined entities, decimal and hexadecimal character references, and
entities declared in the document's internal DTD in text and attribute values. Unknown entities
and references to invalid XML characters produce an error. Numeric references to whitespace
are preserved, including at the edges of text nodes. CDATA is left unchanged.

`validate` checks the parsed tree without decoding its text again.

When the XML document is serialized (using `str` or `pretty_str`), text and attributes are escaped.

The escaping and un-escaping can also be done manually using the `escape_text` and
`unescape_text` methods.
